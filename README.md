  Hello I'm Nick!
 
I just graduated from university with my B.S. with a concentration in software development.
I'm looking forward to dive into the full-stack and game development!

Most of my repositories will be archived school projects- however I hope to put out some more public passion projects as time progresses.
My specialites are Java and C++. However I'm very versitile in many other coding disclipines like SQL, Node.js, React, Javascript, HTML, EJS, CSS and more.
